# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard
Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and presenting insights through an interactive dashboard. The analysis includes data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization, performed in Google Colab, followed by dashboard development to display key metrics and trends.

🎯 Features

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed statistical summaries and visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Interactive Dashboard: Built using Power BI.

Customer Churn Insights: Displays key KPIs, churn rate trends, and factor analysis.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for easy data exploration.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Google Colab: Used for EDA, data preprocessing, and visualization.

Python: Primary programming language.

Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and processing.

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization.

Power BI: For building the dashboard.

Scikit-learn (if applicable): Used for any predictive modeling.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains customer details, usage patterns, and churn labels.

Main features include customer demographics, service usage, billing info, and churn status.

🚀 Run the Dashboard

Since the dashboard is built using Power BI, open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop to explore the visualizations.

📊 Usage Guide

Open the Power BI file in Power BI Desktop.

Connect the dataset (if required) or use the preloaded one.

Explore churn insights, visualize key trends, and interact with the data.

🔥 Future Enhancements

Add predictive modeling to forecast churn probabilities.

Deploy dashboard online for public access.
